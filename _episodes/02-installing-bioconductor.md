# Installing BiocManager

The *[BiocManager](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/BiocManager)* is the entry point into Bioconductor.
This is technically the only Bioconductor package distributed on the CRAN repository.
As such, the package can be installed using the traditional `install.packages()` function.


~~~
install.packages("BiocManager")
~~~
{: .language-r}

# Bioconductor releases and current version

The Bioconductor project produces two releases each year, one around April and another one around October.

The April release of Bioconductor coincides with the annual release of R.
Packages in that Bioconductor release are tested for the upcoming version of R.
Users must install the new version of R to access the new version of those packages.

The October release of Bioconductor continue to work with the same version of R for that annual cycle.

Each time a new release is made, the minor version of all the packages in the Bioconductor repository is incremented by one.
In particular, the version of the *[BiocVersion](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/BiocVersion)* package is used to represent the version of the Bioconductor project.

Once the *[BiocManager](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/BiocManager)* package is installed, the `BiocManager::version()` function displays the version (i.e., release) of the Bioconductor project that is currently active in the R session.


~~~
BiocManager::version()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] '3.13'
~~~
{: .output}

It is possible to specify a version of Bioconductor, which in turn will install the latest version of Bioconductor packages for that particular Bioconductor release.
For instance:

~~~
BiocManager::install(version = "3.13")
~~~
{: .language-r}

# Check for updates

The `BiocManager::valid()` function checks the version of currently installed packages, and checks whether a new version is available for any of them on the Bioconductor repository.

Conveniently, if any package can be updated, the function generates and displays the command needed to update those packages.
Users simply need to copy-paste and run that command in their R console.

If everything is up-to-date, the function will simply print `TRUE`.

~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'getOption("repos")' replaces Bioconductor standard repositories, see
'?repositories' for details

replacement repositories:
    CRAN: https://cloud.r-project.org

# Installing packages

The `BiocManager::install()` function is used to install packages.
The function first searches for the requested package(s) on the Bioconductor repository, but falls back on the CRAN repository and also supports installation from GitHub repositories.

For instance, we can install the *[BiocPkgTools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/BiocPkgTools)* package:


~~~
BiocManager::install("BiocPkgTools")
~~~
{: .language-r}

* Release cycle - release vs devel
